About otc-tools
===============
This is the otc tool for using the Open Telekom Cloud APIs.  It is a simple
demonstrator using shell/curl/jq to use the OpenTelekomCloud's OpenStack and
OTC specific REST interfaces.  It is used for testing by the OTC engineering
team and can be used as a blueprint for own tooling. Unlike the more
extensive tools, this one does not pull in a load of dependencies.

Prefix any command by debug to observe the REST calls being made.

For production use, we recommend using the native OpenStack python client tools
(python-novaclient etc or the newer python-openstackclient), complemented by
the python-otcctools for specific OTC functions.  Or of course higher level
tools, such as ansible with python-shade or terraform.

Usage
-----
Set your OpenStack environment (OS_ variables) just like you do for the native
OpenStack clients (typically by sourcing a ~/.ostackrc or ~/novarc or ~/.openrc
file).

Optionally, you can also set some additional defaults on otc_env.sh by editing
it and copying it into your home as ~/.otc_env.sh.

When managing multipe OTC domains, you may create ~/.ostackrc.SUFFIX and
~/.s3rc.SUFFIX and set OTC_DOMAIN=SUFFIX to make otc read these files.

Please have a look the otc_env.sh file and look at the output from otc help --
this provides sufficient information to get doing.

Limitations
-----------
This tool does not try to cover all functionality of ITC. Rather it tries to 
be a demo and test tool for many functions; it however does fill in some gaps
where the OTC API is extended or different from the standard OpenStack API,
so feel free to use it here and contribute to fill gaps you care about. There
is a small, but active community on github.com/OpenTelekomCloud/.

The OpenStack REST API has a paginated interfaces to allow the consumer to
control how large a response may get. otc-tools currently just always tries
to get everything in one go; it increases the default limits to at least
500 (higher, up to 1200 in some categories). These limits should be more than
large enough to avoid you running into them if you move within the default
quotas. However, if you have very large environments, keep in mind that
otc-tools might not show you the whole truth any more. Please talk to us
or submit a PR if you need further increases in the limits.

Output formatting
-----------------
otc tools tries to output things in a human readable format. It has two basic
formats:

* The list format: It creates a table with columns that are separated by 3 spaces.
  Several values in a field are separated by one space (or a colon for ip:port
  and for vmid:device). The first three columns are standardized, first is the
  ID of the resource, second the name, third the status (if reported), then
  further information (size, AZ, relations, ...) is appended.
  There can be an optional header (explaining the column contents) which starts
  with a '#'.
  This format is returned by list and details subcommands and is supposed to be 
  parsed by humans.
* The JSON format: The REST calls return JSON objects of course and jq is used
  to present a nicely formatted represntation of the object. The JSON can be
  further passed.
* The long running requests report the TASKID as last output, unless we wait
  for further progress. In the latter case, the ID of the created resource
  is output last.

This has been tidied up for otc-tools-0.7 and should be more usable and less
fragile now. Nevertheless, this tool is not yet mature enough that we commit
to not break things here yet -- a future version might well provide switches
to control the output. Pull requests are welcome :-)

Packages
--------
Packages (RPMs/DEBs) on open Build Service home:garloff:OTC
https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:garloff:OTC/otc-tools

A docker container image 
[tsiotc/otc-client](https://hub.docker.com/r/tsiotc/otc-client)
is available on dockerhub.

You can of course also just grab this script from github; please install
curl and jq to make it work; optionally also s3 (libs3/libs3-2).
