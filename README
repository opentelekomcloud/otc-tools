This is the otc tool for using the Open Telekom Cloud APIs.
Copy the otc_env.sh into your home as ~/.otc_env.sh or better 
create and source a standard OpenStack .ostackrc or novarc file to 
set the environment variables for the otc tool. When managing multipe
domains, you may create ~/.ostackrc.SUFFIX and ~/.s3rc.SUFFIX
and set OTC_DOMAIN=SUFFIX to make otc use these files.

Please have a look the otc_env.sh file and look at the output 
from otc -- this provides sufficient information to get doing.

Note that you can use standard OpenStack Client command line tools;
have a look at the documentation. This tool is a demonstrator for
how simple the REST calls can be done with curl if you want to 
build your own tooling. It uses the OpenStack APIs as well as some
of the custom OTC APIs.
