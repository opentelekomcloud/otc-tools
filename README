About otc-tools
===============
This is the otc tool for using the Open Telekom Cloud APIs.  It is a simple
demonstrator using shell/curl/jq to use the OpenTelekomCloud's OpenStack and
OTC specific REST interfaces.  It is used for testing by the OTC engineering
team and can be used as a blueprint for own tooling. Unlike the more
extensive tools, this one does not pull in a load of dependencies.

For production use, we recommend using the native OpenStack python client tools
(python-novaclient etc or the newer python-openstackclient), complemented by
the python-otcctools for specific OTC functions.  Or of course higher level
tools, such as ansible with python-shade or terraform.

Usage
-----
Set your OpenStack environment (OS_ variables) just like you do for the native
OpenStack clients (typically by sourcing a ~/.ostackrc or ~/novarc or ~/.openrc
file).

Optionally, you can also set some additional defaults on otc_env.sh by editing
it and copying it into your home as ~/.otc_env.sh.

When managing multipe OTC domains, you may create ~/.ostackrc.SUFFIX and
~/.s3rc.SUFFIX and set OTC_DOMAIN=SUFFIX to make otc use these files.

Please have a look the otc_env.sh file and look at the output from otc help --
this provides sufficient information to get doing.
